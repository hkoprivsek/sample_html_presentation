### Introduction

+ Data set related to homes on the Melbourne housing market
  - 34,857 total observations and 21 different variables
  - 8 categorical variables (e.g. Suburb, Address, Method of Sale, etc.), 13 numerical (e.g.         Number of Rooms, Selling Price, Distance From Central Business District, etc.)
+ Exploratory Data Analysis & MLR with Selling Price as response variable
  - Best MLR model chosen from several candidate models

### Exploratory Data Analysis

+ Group location variable created using latitude/longitude data
  - factor variable: **main.group**, 1 = in main cluster of houses, 0 = not in main cluster
